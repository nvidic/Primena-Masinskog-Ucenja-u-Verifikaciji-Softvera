bubble_sort_linux.c - Bubble-Sort implementation operating on native Linux lists
bubble_sort_linux_BUG.c - bubble_sort_linux.c with an injected bug

dll_of_dll.c - NULL-terminated doubly-linked list of doubly-linked lists
dll_of_dll_BUG.c - dll_of_dll.c with an injected bug
  The program creates a doubly-linked list of doubly-linked lists, 
  then destroys the shape in several phases.

merge_sort.c - Merge-Sort algorithm operating on two level singly-linked lists
merge_sort_BUG.c - merge_sort.c with an injected bug

sll_to_dll_rev.c - conversion of singly-linked list to doubly-linked list
sll_to_dll_rev_BUG.c - sll_to_dll_rev.c with an injected bug
  The program converts a singly-linked list to a doubly-linked list, 
  reverses the list, and then coverts it back to a singly-linked list.

tree* - build a simple tree and check certain data properties about it.
